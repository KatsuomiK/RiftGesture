RiftGesture
===========
An experiment to recognize head gestures (nod and headshake) with Oculus Rift and Unity.

# Requirements

- Oculus Rift CV1/DK2
- Unity 5.4.0

# Scenes

This project contains two scenes.

### Test.unity

A test scene to detect gestures. You can tweak DetectNod and DetectHeadshake functions in "Frame Synthesis/Rift Gesture/RiftGesture.cs."

### Script Example/Script Example.unity

A simple example to use the gesture detection. For some reason the script messages are written in Japanese. You can edit "Script Example/Resources/script.txt."
